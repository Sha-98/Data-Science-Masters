        "**ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)** is a statistical technique used to compare the means of more than two groups. It is based on the **F-distribution** and assumes the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **1. Independence:** The observations are independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one observation does not affect the outcome of another observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **2. Normality:** The data within each group follows a normal distribution. This assumption can be checked using Q-Q plots or tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **3. Homogeneity of variances:** The variance of the data is equal across all groups. This assumption can be checked using Levene's test or Bartlett's test.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Violations of these assumptions can impact the validity of the results and lead to incorrect conclusions. Here are some examples of violations:***\n",
        "\n",
        "- **1. Dependence:** If the observations are not independent, the F-test used in ANOVA may not be valid. For example, if you are comparing the test scores of students in different classrooms, and some students have siblings in other classrooms, the scores may not be independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **2. Non-normality:** If the data within a group does not follow a normal distribution, the F-test may not be valid. For example, if you are comparing the weights of mice from different treatment groups, and the weights of mice in one group are heavily skewed, the normality assumption is violated.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **3. Heteroscedasticity:** If the variance of the data is not equal across all groups, the F-test may not be valid. For example, if you are comparing the salaries of employees in different departments, and the variance of salaries is much larger in one department than in others, the homogeneity of variances assumption is violated.\n",
        "\n",
        "***When these assumptions are violated, it may still be possible to use ANOVA, but alternative methods such as the Welch ANOVA or non-parametric tests like the Kruskal-Wallis test may be more appropriate. It is important to assess the impact of these violations on the results and interpret them with caution.***"

They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store n those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other.**"
