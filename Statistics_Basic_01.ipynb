        "\n",
        "**02. Descriptive Statistics:** Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. Measures such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation are used to provide a concise summary.\n",

        "**03. Inferential Statistics:** Inferential statistics involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to estimate parameters and test hypotheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**04. Hypothesis Testing:** In hypothesis testing, statistical methods are used to assess the validity of assumptions or hypotheses about a population based on a sample. It helps determine whether observed differences or effects are statistically significant.\n",
