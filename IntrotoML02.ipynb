        "**1. High Bias Model (Linear Regression):**\n",
        "* **Characteristics:** Assumes a linear relationship between features and target variable, may fail to capture nonlinear patterns.\n",
        "* **Performance:** May underfit the data, resulting in high training and validation errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. High Variance Model (Decision Trees):**\n",
        "* **Characteristics:** Highly flexible and capable of capturing complex interactions in the data.\n",
        "* **Performance:** Prone to overfitting, leading to low training error but significantly higher validation error.\n",

        "***In summary, high bias models tend to oversimplify the problem, leading to underfitting, while high variance models tend to capture noise or fluctuations in the training data, resulting in overfitting. Achieving the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for building models that generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques, cross-validation, and model selection help address bias-variance trade-offs and improve model performance.***"
