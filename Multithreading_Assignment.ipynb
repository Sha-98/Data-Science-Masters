        "Ans. Multithreading is a concurrent execution technique which allows a python program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. In simple words, we know that our computers have multiple cores, some have four (quad-core processor) while some have eight core (octa-core processor). The programs we develop and run are running on these cores, one program per core at one time. Now, if we want to run multiple programs on one single core, keeping rest of the cores free for other work, we can do that using the concept of threading.\n",

        "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Multithreading is a powerful technique used in software development to perform multiple tasks concurrently within a single process. However, it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved Performance: Multithreading can lead to improved performance, especially on multi-core processors. It allows multiple threads to execute tasks in parallel, making better use of available CPU resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of an application. For example, in a graphical user interface (GUI) application, one thread can handle user input and events while another thread performs background tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Efficient Resource Utilization: Threads share the same process memory space, reducing the overhead of creating separate processes. This efficient resource sharing makes multithreading a lightweight solution\n",
        "\n",
        "* Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Complexity: Multithreaded code can be challenging to write, debug, and maintain. Synchronization issues, race conditions, and deadlocks are common problems in multithreaded applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Resource Contention: When multiple threads access shared resources (e.g., variables, data structures) concurrently, resource contention can occur, leading to unpredictable behavior and performance degradation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Difficulty in Debugging: Debugging multithreaded code can be complex and time-consuming. Issues may be intermittent and hard to reproduce.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Platform Dependency: Multithreading behavior can vary across different platforms and operating systems, making it less portable.\n"

        "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Deadlocks and race conditions are two common concurrency-related issues that can occur in multithreaded or multiprocess applications. Let's explain each of them:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Deadlock:\n",
        "\n",
        "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other(s) to release a resource. In other words, they are stuck in a circular wait.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deadlocks typically happen when multiple threads compete for exclusive access to resources (e.g., locks, memory, or files) and they acquire resources in different orders.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Race Condition:\n",
        "\n",
        "A race condition occurs when two or more threads or processes access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the timing or order of their execution. This can lead to unpredictable and incorrect results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Race conditions typically happen when multiple threads access shared resources or variables without proper synchronization, and at least one thread modifies the resource."
