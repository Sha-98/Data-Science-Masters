        "Answer: The four pillars of Object Oriented Programming are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "What is abstract class?\n",
        "The methods which do not have body, or is not performing any task or does not possess any logic is called an abstract method. The class consisting the abstract method is called the abstract class. And we cannot create an object of an abstract class. However, python does not support creating an abstract class. To create an abstract class in python we use a library 'abc' and import 'ABC' and 'abstractmethod' from it. Then we have to use a decorator '@abstractmethod' inside a class to define the class as an abastract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, the class inheriting the abstract class must define all the abstract method present in the parent class. This is how we are able to use the abstraction and inheritance in the object oriented programming in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we need it?\n",
        "The need of an abstract class in the object oriented programming. It makes sense when we are developing a system and writing the code for that in the oops method. It give our code a flow and a systematic structure making the code clean and reusable. Abstraction is a way to create a flow in the code and to create a clean and structured code for our project. Large applications having multiple features, and classes for them, the practice of following oops and using abstraction helps the programmer to design their code in a good and understandable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "In one word, \"Encapsulation\" means hiding the stuff from the users to ensure safety of your code and program.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Object Oriented Programming, we have a concept through which we can hide the variables, and objects from the users or restrict them to accessing these directly by creating specific methods for users to use and do their desired tasks, without touching the real variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The principle of Encapsulation states that all the imporatant information is contained by the objects and as developers, you should only expose the selective, most needed information only.\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of \"Encapsulation\", the idea of hiding provides a greater security to your code and avoids unnecessary or unintended data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "In real world, or industry level use cases, \"Encapsulation\" is very important to secure the valuable assets of the company.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "In Object Oriented Programming, Inheritance is a concept to connect or establish a relationship between the classes and the objects , or among multiple classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "The literal meaning of inheritance is to inherit the properties from the parent. In OOP, the concept of inheritance allows us to use the properties of the parent class in the child class very easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interesting thing here is that along with inheriting the properties and methods from the parent class, the child class can also have its own properties and methods. Also, we can also perform multiple inheritance along with direct and indirect inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ease in using the properties, objects, and methods defined in the parent class through the child class allows the programmer to write clean, concise, and connected code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is one of the four pillers of Object Oriented Programming. It is a concept where objects are designed in a way to share behaviours with one another but process the data in different way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simple real life connection here is the humans, we are always the same person, everywhere we go. However, our behaviour and our actions differs in different situation. Same way the class having a function with one logic can process different objects and different data in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "In polymorphism, the program determines which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of the object from a parent class. It reduces the need to duplicate the code for every new possibility and helps the programmer to maintain clean code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, a child class is created extending the functionality of the parent class allowing different types of objects to pass through same interface, producing respective results for each different type of object.\n"
